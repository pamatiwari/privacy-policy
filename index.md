To operate, maintain, and improve the functionality and performance of the application.

To analyze app usage, detect bugs, and improve user experience using anonymous analytics and crash reports.

To ensure the security, stability, and proper functioning of the application.

# Media & Storage Access

Our application requests access to the device’s media storage only to allow users to select images and videos from their device gallery for color transfer and editing purposes.

Access to media files is strictly user-initiated and is used only within the application to perform the selected features.

The application does not access, modify, or upload any media files without the user’s explicit action. Selected images and videos are processed only as required for app functionality and are not shared with third parties without user consent.


# Third-Party Services

The application uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

These third-party services are used to improve app functionality, performance, and stability.

The application uses the following third-party services:

• Google AdMob – used to display advertisements.
• Firebase Crashlytics – used to monitor app crashes and improve stability.

These third-party services may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We do not control how these services collect or use data.

We do not share personally identifiable information with third-party services unless required to provide app functionality or comply with legal obligations.


# Data Retention & Deletion

User-selected images and videos may be temporarily uploaded to our secure servers for processing in order to provide the requested features of the application.

Media files are retained only for the time necessary to complete processing and deliver the results back to the user. Once processing is completed, the files are automatically deleted from our servers within a reasonable period, unless longer retention is required for technical or legal reasons.

The application does not permanently store user media files on its servers.

Anonymous analytics and crash-related data collected through third-party services such as Firebase Crashlytics may be retained for a limited period in accordance with their respective privacy policies.

Users may stop all data collection by uninstalling the application.


# Security of Data

We value your trust in providing us with your information and are committed to protecting it. We implement reasonable technical and organizational security measures to safeguard user data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

User media files uploaded for server-side processing are transmitted securely and are accessible only for the purpose of providing the requested functionality.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect user information, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

This application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take immediate steps to delete it from our servers.
