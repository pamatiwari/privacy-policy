# Introduction

1. Introduction
Effective Date: 12 January 2026

Welcome to Phocyyyyy, an AI-powered media processing application operated by lakyyyyyyy kak. Phocyyyyy is designed to help users apply advanced color transfer and color style transformation to their images and videos using pre-trained artificial intelligence models.

Our application focuses specifically on AI-based color transfer across different types of media. The main features include:

Image-to-Image color transfer

Video-to-Video color transfer

Image-to-Video color style transfer

Video-to-Image color style transfer

These features allow users to apply the color style of one image or video to another while preserving the original structure and content of the media.

In addition to color transfer, Phocyyyyy provides professional adjustment tools that let users fine-tune their media, including:

Contrast

Brightness

Saturation

Hue

Temperature

Tint

To deliver these functionalities, Phocyyyyy uses multiple trusted pre-trained AI models that process media efficiently and securely. We do not sell, rent, or misuse your personal data. Our primary goal is to provide high-quality color transformation and enhancement tools for creative and professional use.

Phocyyyyy may use trusted third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase. These services may collect limited technical information (such as device identifiers, crash reports, and usage statistics) to display advertisements, improve app performance, and ensure application stability.

By using Phocyyyyy, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This application is available on the Google Play Store and is intended for users aged 13 years and above.

Important Note on Media Usage:
We do not use your personal images or videos for any purpose other than providing the requested processing services. Your media files are used strictly to perform color transfer and enhancement operations. They are not used to train our AI models, are not stored permanently on our servers, and are not shared with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.



# Media & Storage Access

Our application requests access to the device’s media storage only to allow users to select images and videos from their device gallery for color transfer and editing purposes.

Access to media files is strictly user-initiated and is used only within the application to perform the selected features.

The application does not access, modify, or upload any media files without the user’s explicit action. Selected images and videos are processed only as required for app functionality and are not shared with third parties without user consent.
