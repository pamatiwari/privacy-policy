# Introduction

1. Introduction
Effective Date: 12 January 2026

Welcome to Phorcysty, an AI-powered media processing application operated by lakyyyyyyy kak. Phorcysty is designed to help users apply advanced color transfer and color style transformation to their images and videos using pre-trained artificial intelligence models.

Our application focuses specifically on AI-based color transfer across different types of media. The main features include:

Image-to-Image color transfer

Video-to-Video color transfer

Image-to-Video color style transfer

Video-to-Image color style transfer

These features allow users to apply the color style of one image or video to another while preserving the original structure and content of the media.

In addition to color transfer, Phorcysty provides professional adjustment tools that let users fine-tune their media, including:

Contrast

Brightness

Saturation

Hue

Temperature

Tint

To deliver these functionalities, Phorcysty uses multiple trusted pre-trained AI models that process media efficiently and securely. We do not sell, rent, or misuse your personal data. Our primary goal is to provide high-quality color transformation and enhancement tools for creative and professional use.

Phorcysty may use trusted third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase. These services may collect limited technical information (such as device identifiers, crash reports, and usage statistics) to display advertisements, improve app performance, and ensure application stability.

By using Phorcysty, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This application is available on the Google Play Store and is intended for users aged 13 years and above.

An active internet connection is required for server-side AI processing, and without internet access, AI-based features may not function properly.
We use network access strictly to provide these services and improve app stability. Personal images or videos are not uploaded or transmitted over the internet without the user’s explicit action and consent.

# Media & Storage Access

Our application requests access to the device’s media storage specifically to allow users to select images and videos for AI-powered color transfer and color style transformation.

User-Initiated Access:
Access to media files is strictly user-initiated. The application only accesses the specific files that you choose to select for color transfer, style transformation, or manual editing.

Processing:
Access is required to perform core functions such as:

Image-to-Image color transfer

Video-to-Video color transfer

Image-to-Video color style transfer

Video-to-Image color style transfer

Saving Results :

The application requires storage access to download the final processed images or videos directly to your device’s gallery when you tap the Download button.

No Background Access:
The application does not access, modify, or upload any media files in the background or without your explicit action.

Temporary Use:
Selected media files are used solely for temporary processing. They are not permanently stored on our servers and are not shared with any third parties. Please note that third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase may collect limited technical and device information for advertising, analytics, and app stability purposes, but they do not access or collect your personal media files.
